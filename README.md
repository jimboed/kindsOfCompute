make changes and updates to the docs ONLY in the "main" branch, never the "gh-pages" branch.
BUT, making edits in the main branch doesnt actually make changes to the docs pages. 

changes only occour AFTER you run the "z_runThisInsteadOfTravis.sh" script.
then the changes in the main branch are pushed to the gh-pages branch with that script, THEN the docs pages change.
